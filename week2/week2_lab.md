# Program 1: 
### Statement: Write an Assembly Program for the following C code
main() {
	unsigned short int a[11] = {0x1234, 0x5678, ...}, h;
	h = 0;
	for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)
	{
		h = h + a[i];
	}
	a[10] = h;
}

we have array called "a" then we Initialize h = 0 and store it in t0 then the loop: Manually add each a[i] to h (t0) that is Load a[0] into t1 ,h = h + a[0],Load a[1] into t1,h = h + a[1]..like this Load a[9] into t1,h = h + a[9] and Store h (t0) in a[10] and Store h in a[10]

# Program 2: 
### Statement: Write an Assembly Program for addition of 2 64-bit numbers on RV32I 
### Name of file:
week2q2.s

### Observation - Single Cycle
take 2 64 bit number divided them into four parts and store as word in array called "a", assign the 4 number to register , then add 2 lsb and store it register, comparing total lsb with 1st lsb ,and both msb and store it register ,comparing total msb with 1st msb,adding total msb with carry and store it in register
